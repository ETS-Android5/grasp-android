Stages:

stage 0: logging events

stage 1: the screen can be split with straight lines
spanning from one side to another

stage 2: the screen splits can be resized and discarded

stage 3: expressions can be edited with touch (e.g. they
can be moved from one view to another);

stage 4: lisp files can be imported and exported

stage 5: atom editing and basic gestutes:
- box
- underscore

  box -> list

  underscore -> atom

stage 6: port to Kawa

further plans:

stage 7: undoing and history tracking

stage 8: expressions can be evaluated

stage 9: support for cursors within expressions and
keyboard editing

stage 10: interaction extension mechanism: certain kinds
of expressions can be interpreted visually. an example:
A* on graphs

stage 11: expressions can be pinned (context menu)  and maximized
(double tap). a pinned expression interprets touch
actions in its own way.



misc:

  vertical bar -> comment / dotted tail

  Q - magnifying glass

  straight line between two editors - start targets end
