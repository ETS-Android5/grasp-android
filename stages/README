Stages:

stage 0: logging events

stage 1: the screen can be split with straight lines
spanning from one side to another

stage 2: the screen splits can be resized and discarded

stage 3: expressions can be edited with touch (e.g. they
can be moved from one view to another);

stage 4: lisp files can be imported and exported

stage 5: shapes can be drawn and associated with names

stage 6: undoing and history tracking

stage 7: expressions can be evaluated

stage 8: support for cursors within expressions and
keyboard editing

stage 9: interaction extension mechanism: certain kinds
of expressions can be interpreted visually. an example:
A* on graphs

stage 10: expressions can be pinned (context menu)  and maximized
(double tap). a pinned expression interprets touch
actions in its own way.
