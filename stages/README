Stages:

stage 0: logging events

stage 1: the screen can be split with straight lines
spanning from one side to another

stage 2: the screen splits can be resized and discarded

stage 3: files can be edited with touch (e.g. expressions
can be moved from one view to another);

stage 4: lisp files can be imported and displayed in views.
documents can be pinned. a pinned document doesn't let
draw gestures, and intetprets the first finger as scroll.
Widgets in a pinned document interpret actions in their own
ways.

stage 5: shapes can be drawn and associated with names.

stage 6: expressions can be evaluated; certain kinds
of expressions can be interpreted visually. an example:
A* on graphs

stage 7: expressions can be pinned (context menu)  and maximized
(double tap). a pinned expression interprets touch
actions in its own way.

stage 8: support for cursors within expressions and
keyboard editing

stage 9: undoing and history tracking
